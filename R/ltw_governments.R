#' @source Election results data provided by the Bundeswahlleiter. A machine-readable version of the data in the pdf available here (\url{https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/service/landtagswahlen.html}) was kindly provided to me. Election data outside the timeframe covered by Bundeswahlleiter's data provided to me was collected from the states' local election authorities' (Landeswahlleiter) websites. Further election data was collected from the respective Landeswahlleiters. More information on parties and the continuity of parties under different labels was collected by me. Information on Governments mainly taken from the replication data of Linhart, Eric, Franz U. Pappi und Ralf Schmitt (2008): Die proportionale Ministerienaufteilung in deutschen Koalitionsregierungen: Akzeptierte Norm oder das Ausnutzen strategischer Vorteile?, Politische Vierteljahresschrift 49(1): 46-67. To be found online here: \url{https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/phil/politik/pspi/forschung/daten.php}. Information outside the timeframe of Linhart et al. was collected by me, mainly from German Wikipedia.
